# Product Requirements Document: ComplianceSync - MVP

## Product Concept

ComplianceSync is a compliance evidence management platform designed for small regulated businesses (5-50 employees) in financial services, insurance, and healthcare. It solves the critical problem of scattered, manual compliance documentation by automatically capturing evidence of regulatory adherence across existing workplace tools (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, Slack), organizing it against pre-built regulatory requirement templates, and maintaining audit-ready records. The platform enables compliance officers and office managers to shift from reactive, stressful audit preparation to proactive, automated compliance monitoring.

## Target User Personas

### Sarah Chen - Compliance Officer
Sarah is a 38-year-old Compliance Officer at a 22-person registered investment advisory firm. She's responsible for ensuring the firm meets SEC and FINRA requirements but lacks dedicated compliance software budget. Her day involves manually collecting evidence of training completion, tracking policy acknowledgments, and preparing for annual audits. Her primary frustration is spending 15+ hours per quarter gathering screenshots, emails, and documents from various systems to prove compliance activities occurred. She needs a solution that passively collects this evidence automatically so she can focus on risk assessment rather than administrative documentation.

### Marcus Rodriguez - Office Manager with Compliance Duties
Marcus is a 45-year-old Office Manager at a 12-person insurance brokerage who inherited compliance responsibilities when the firm grew. He has no formal compliance training and finds regulatory requirements overwhelming. His biggest challenge is not knowing what evidence he should be collecting or when requirements are due. He needs clear guidance on what his state insurance department expects and a simple way to capture proof that policies are being followed without becoming a compliance expert himself.

### Dr. Jennifer Williams - Medical Practice Principal
Jennifer is a 52-year-old physician who owns a 30-person medical practice. She's ultimately responsible for HIPAA compliance and state medical board requirements but delegates day-to-day compliance tasks to her practice administrator. Her primary concern is audit risk and potential fines that could threaten her practice. She needs visibility into compliance status without learning complex systems, confidence that evidence is being collected correctly, and the ability to quickly produce documentation when regulators request it. Her secondary goal is minimizing the time her clinical staff spends on compliance documentation so they can focus on patient care.

### Alex Thompson - IT-Savvy Firm Principal
Alex is a 41-year-old managing partner at a 35-person financial advisory firm with a strong technology background. He understands the value of automation and integration but is frustrated by enterprise compliance tools that are overengineered and overpriced for his firm size. He wants a modern, cloud-native solution that integrates seamlessly with his existing Google Workspace environment, provides real-time visibility into compliance posture, and scales as his firm grows. He's willing to invest in the right tool but needs to see ROI within the first quarter through reduced audit preparation time.

## Core Goal of MVP

Enable a compliance officer at a small regulated business to automatically capture evidence of compliance activities from their existing workplace tools, map that evidence to regulatory requirements using pre-built templates, and generate audit-ready documentation within 30 days of onboarding.

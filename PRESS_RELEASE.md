## ComplianceSync Launches Cloud-Native Platform That Makes Enterprise-Grade Compliance Accessible to Small Regulated Businesses

### Purpose-Built Solution Delivers Automated Evidence Capture and Audit-Ready Documentation at 20% of Traditional Enterprise Cost

**SAN FRANCISCO, CA – October 30, 2025** – ComplianceSync today announced the launch of its cloud-native compliance documentation platform designed specifically for small regulated businesses. The new platform addresses a critical gap in the compliance software market by delivering enterprise-grade audit trails, automated evidence collection, and regulatory requirement tracking at a price point accessible to firms with 5-50 employees.

Small businesses in regulated industries face mounting compliance obligations but lack the resources for enterprise compliance software or dedicated compliance officers. ComplianceSync eliminates the fragmented documentation across email, spreadsheets, and file shares that creates audit anxiety and consumes 10-20 hours per month of manual tracking effort. The platform connects seamlessly to existing business tools including Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, and Slack to automatically capture compliance evidence without disrupting daily workflows.

"Compliance shouldn't be a competitive disadvantage for small firms doing the right thing," said Sarah Chen, CEO and Founder of ComplianceSync. "We built ComplianceSync because registered investment advisors, insurance agencies, and healthcare practices deserve the same audit readiness as Fortune 500 companies without the enterprise price tag or six-month implementation timelines. Our customers go from signup to audit-ready in hours, not months."

## Solving Real Pain Points for Regulated Small Businesses

The compliance burden for small regulated businesses has intensified dramatically. Financial advisors must satisfy SEC and FINRA requirements, insurance agencies navigate state-specific regulations, and healthcare practices maintain HIPAA compliance—all while running their core businesses with limited administrative staff. Traditional solutions require annual commitments starting at $50,000 or force teams to adapt generic project management tools that lack compliance-specific capabilities.

ComplianceSync transforms compliance documentation from a manual burden into an automated process that happens in the background of existing work:

**Smart Evidence Capture**: Browser extensions and email integrations automatically identify, tag, and archive compliance-relevant documents, communications, and activities. Teams maintain complete documentation without changing how they work.

**Regulatory Requirement Dashboard**: Pre-built templates for common regulations including FINRA, SEC RIA rules, HIPAA, and state insurance requirements provide immediate visibility into completion status, upcoming deadlines, and documentation gaps. Firms know exactly where they stand at any moment.

**Audit-Ready Reports**: Generate comprehensive compliance documentation packages organized by regulatory requirement with one click. Immutable timestamps and complete chain-of-custody tracking satisfy auditor requirements for evidence integrity.

**Tamper-Proof Audit Trails**: Every action, document version, and system event is logged in immutable audit trails that meet regulatory standards for record retention and evidence preservation.

## Built for Small Businesses, Powered by Enterprise Technology

ComplianceSync runs on Google Cloud Platform infrastructure, providing bank-level security and reliability while maintaining the simplicity small businesses require. The cloud-native architecture ensures automatic updates, guaranteed uptime, and seamless scalability as firms grow.

The platform serves registered investment advisors (RIAs), independent insurance agencies, small medical and dental practices, mortgage brokers, and accounting firms—any regulated business between 5-50 employees that needs professional compliance documentation without enterprise complexity.

## Transparent Pricing That Fits Small Business Budgets

ComplianceSync offers three subscription tiers designed to grow with customer needs:

**Starter Plan – $149/month** (up to 10 users): Single regulatory framework, core evidence capture, and basic reporting capabilities. Ideal for firms just establishing formal compliance processes.

**Professional Plan – $349/month** (up to 25 users): Multiple regulatory frameworks, advanced integrations with business tools, and custom requirement tracking. Designed for firms managing complex compliance obligations across multiple jurisdictions.

**Business Plan – $699/month** (up to 50 users): Unlimited frameworks, API access for custom workflows, priority support, and quarterly compliance consultant reviews. Built for established firms with sophisticated compliance needs.

All plans include secure cloud storage, unlimited audit trail retention, and access to the regulatory requirement template library. No long-term contracts or hidden fees—customers can start, pause, or cancel monthly subscriptions at any time.

## Immediate Availability

ComplianceSync is available now with a 30-day free trial. Businesses can sign up and begin documenting compliance activities within hours through the self-service onboarding process. The platform includes guided setup workflows, regulatory template selection, and integration configuration wizards that eliminate implementation complexity.

"Our pilot customers are saving an average of 15 hours per month on compliance documentation," added Chen. "More importantly, they're sleeping better knowing they have complete, defensible audit trails that will stand up to regulatory scrutiny. That peace of mind is transformative for small business owners who previously worried constantly about compliance gaps."
